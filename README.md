# F# Prolog

This is a project to implement a simple Prolog interpreter in F#.

The project defines the types and functions for terms, variables, unification, clauses, goals, and queries, but leaves them unimplemented.

The goal is to use F# features such as pattern matching, option types, and list comprehensions to write a concise and elegant Prolog solver.
